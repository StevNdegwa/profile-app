### Approach to the project:

- Identify all the requirements
- Transform the requirements to features
- Design the UI features
- Transform the features to components
- Code refactoring - Ensuring components and code follows best practices
  - Single responsibility principle
  - Memoization
  - DRY - Don't repeat yourself
- As the application grew, the componets changed, added more props, and broke down some

### Challenges faced:

- Creating a great UI in a short period of time

### What I'd have done differently if I had more time

- Prioritise unit tests
- Improve data validation for the form
- Add custom styles to make the UI great

### How to run the application locally

- Clone this repo
- Use `yarn` or `npm` to install the packages
  - `yarn`
  - `npm install`
- use `yarn` or `npm` to run the application
  - `yarn start`
  - `npm run start`
