### Approach to the project:

- Identify all the requirements
- Design the applications
- Transform the requirements to features
- Transform the features to components
- Code refactoring - Ensuring components and code follows best practices
  - Single responsibility principle
  - Memoization
  - DRY - Don't repeat yourself

### Challenges faced:

- Difficulty using Formik with Antd Form, the have close to similar features. I had to choose which features to use and which to leave.

### What I'd have done differently if I had more time

- Prioritise unit tests
